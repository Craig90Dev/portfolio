      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>Who</h3>
      <p>
        "Hello World!" My name is Craig Arrowsmith (formerly Farran) and I'm a Junior Web Developer based near Glasgow in sunny Scotland.
        I'm currently making my way through a Full-Stack Developement course with Code Institute where I'm learning the basic fundementals of HTML, CSS, JS, Python, JQuery and
        Django.
        I decided to create this portfolio to showcase some of my projects for the course and also some of the personal projects I have been playing with along the way.
      </p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm not sat at my computer coding I'm a fan of sitting at my computer and losing at video games such as Escape from Tarkov and HellDivers II. 
        <br>
        When I'm not at my computer I'm either falling down hills on a bike/snowboard (weather dependant) or climbing up them with a pair of hiking boots and a flask of coffee.
        I'm also a fan of binge watching TV series with the other half whilst eating chocolate.
      </p>
      <h3>Facts</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an ex-submariner with the Royal Navy for almost 11 years where I spent countless months without contact from the outside world (yes, that means no internet.. 
        or even computer for that matter) and lived a very repetative life, only knowing what day it was by the meals provided (my favourite being steak night saturdays).
        <br>
        I used to own nine guinea pigs (you read that right).
        <br>
        I now only live with two Guinea Pigs, Edith and Vera (no, they're not 80 years old), who enjoy a good run around the living-room and chewing anything they can get their
        tiny paws on.
